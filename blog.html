My time in mod 1 was so many emotions combined, both positive and negative.
I struggled and perservered and pushed through.  Learning ruby was intense and
fun.  With my level of understanding the the ruby language and with continual
practice, I don't look at other languages with uncertainty anymore.  Instead I
now look at code with excitement, "can I do this thing? If not now, I know I
will be able to soon!".  I realize now, how fast code is changing.  I'm starting
to understand Turing's processes and why they are advantageous.  So now when I
read about new languages I start to look for what they do different than others.

I think that my favorite technical concept is the collective of understanding
the languages fully, from top to bottom.  That excites me the most.  I don't
100% know ruby, but I want to, or at least keep progressing.  I want to apply
this to all languages.  I like understanding the details of why and how things
work.
